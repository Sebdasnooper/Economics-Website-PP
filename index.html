  <div class="Websitedesc"> This website was created for those who are begining to have an interest in economics. This website is aimed to generally teach about the importance of economics. This website should not be interpreted as a place full of everything that you will need to ever know about economics as things change all the time. As a result it is recomended for any readers that want to know more to do their own resarch on the topic. </div>
  <div class="Websitedesc2"> It is also importnat to not that the website also has a lean towards Austrian economics and the freedom and liberty of the individual. This is because it has been shown that capitalist and more free market systems have lead towards prosperity towards the nations that have used such a system. </div>
