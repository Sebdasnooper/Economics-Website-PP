  <h2> History </h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    Brazil had started off as a coherent state as a colony of Portugal and seen as a minor colony as Portugal was focused more
    on its eastern colonies and their spice trades. This made Brazil take a long time to develop, expand, and grow into its
    modern-day borders.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    When Napoleon occupied most of Iberia this caused the monarchy to flee and move to Brazil where they established a new
    government that opened its trade routes to other nations especially the British.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    After Napoleon was defeated and sometime of anti-monarchal demonstrations in Portugal the monarchy had to return but the
    King’s son who was named Pedro I rule over Brazil. This led him to declare independence and formed a constitutional
    Monarchy.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    The monarchy lasted sometime overseeing many reforms similar to that of a normal republic at the time. Brazil only had 2
    monarchs and after the abolition of slavery many aristocrats and members of the military overthrew the monarchy and
    established a democracy.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    This democracy is not verry successful as its elections were controlled and swayed. Though much of its history onwards a set
    of dictators, and military rulers over Brazil moved it away from democracy until the 1980’s.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2> Recent History </h2>
  <br>
  <div class="Picture">

  <p>
    One of Brazil’s most influential leaders came in the early 2000’s with the election of Lula Da Silva. In this government
    social reforms similar to that of China were made and the economy grew massively starting from a GDP of 500 billion in 2003
    and growing to 2.6 trillion in 2011.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    This led to prosperity and stability and created predictions of Brazil being the next superpower. These predictions did not
    last and with a slowing economy and a opening case of corruption in the Petrobras scandal things are going to get bad for
    Brazil. Through operation carwash it was found that $2.5 Billion dollars of funds from the company had been used in
    corruption.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Oil operations such as the one seen from Petrobras funded many of the social programs that were set from Lula Da Silva and
    with many of these funds being misallocated through the years and with statements in the media of being unable to fund
    such programs instability strike the nation.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Through instability this reduced confidence in the economy and lead to economic downturn with a growing retiring population.
    This helped Brazil fall into the middle-income trap that has destroyed so many growing/ emerging economies.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2> Middle-Income Trap </h2>
  <br>
  <div class="Picture2">

<br>
<br>
  <p>
    Many emerging economies such as Brazil in the early 2000s see a large growth in its economy and a massive boom as companies
    begin to use their cheap labor to manufacture goods. Farmers seeing the growing opportunity of the cheap labor which pays
    better than farming joins in and grows the economy as more people can buy more goods.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    This creates a rise in the standard of living and a fall of birth rates. Fewer farmers are moving to cities and more people
    retire from work due to old age. This makes a fall in productivity as its labor is no longer competitive as they demand
    more pay or more benefits which was only accelerated with the labor laws created by Lula Da Silva. This results in the
    slowing of the economy as it begins to be stagnant or even begins to shrink over time in the case of Brazil.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    The way to get out of this middle-income trap is to get their own international companies and innovation to export and
    crate wealth outside of just the cheap labor. This is what many rich countries have been doing. Nations like Japan, South
    Korea, and the UAE used innovation to be pushed into a much richer country. Through its many companies and innovative
    breakthroughs, it is beginning to move past its cheap labor and transition into a rich economy.
  </p>

  <h2> Brazilian Geography </h2>
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
  Brazil’s economy is also been massively affected by its geography as its many coastal mountains separating its cities along
  with the massive ecological reserves and the Amazon rainforest leaves only a small amount of Brazil to be habitable. These
  areas also tend to be split up from each other. This results in more smaller cities which limits trade between cities and
  his also hinders innovation.
</p>
<br>
<h2> Analysis </h2>
<br>
<p>
  Brazil is facing the problems of an aging population and falling fertility rates. The nation is also facing the middle-income
  trap and is unable to effectively break out as its industries and populations centers are separated by massive mountains and
  rainforests that are hard to navigate creating a smaller economy.
</p>
<br>
<p>
	The nation is facing instability with its corruption scandals and growing deficit along with a worsening economic situation.
  This leads to a reduction in confidence for the economy and a less productive workforce.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Overall, its issues can be summarized to a few key points:
</p>
<li>
<ul> Bad geography </ul>
<ul> Slowing economy </ul>
<ul> A lack of innovative industries </ul>
<br>
<h2> Possible solutions </h2>
  <br>
  <h3> Instability </h3>
  <br>
  <p>
To bring stability crackdowns on protests and growing state powers temporarily will bring stability. Making these powers time
bound backed by many in the government to enforce such rules is important as more authoritarian tend to trade stability for
long term growth. So trading for it temporarily will bring back stability.
</p>
<br>
<h3> Bad Geography </h3>
  <br>
<p>
Such an issue cannot be solved easily as many of these natural reserves are protected by international forces and as a result
a solution cannot be easily found.
</p>
<br>
<h3> Slowing Economy </h3>
<br>
<p>
This will be solved similarly to the lack of innovative industries which is through deregulation and creating a more
competitive market for the economy to be able to have. This will grow the economy and lead to more innovative industries as
entrepreneurs have more free space to look around and improve the nation.
</p>
<br>
 <h3> A lack of innovative industries </h3>
 <br>
<p>
This as stated in the slowing economy solution be dealt with by allowing entrepreneurs to enter the market and reduce barriers
of entry to allow them to innovate and create companies that add back to its nation.
</p>
<br>
<h2> Summary </h2>
<br>
<p>
  Brazil is one of the most special and interesting nations to analyze and what can go wrong in a rising economy. Through the years of instability and corruption in the nation along with an aging population this has been made as prime target for the middle-income trap as the economy is becoming more stagnant.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Overall it is important that we learn from the mistakes of Brazil which are instability, corruption, large natural barriers and a lack of innovation which has led to a stagnant economy in the end as its labor force is becoming less and less competitive compared to many other nations.
