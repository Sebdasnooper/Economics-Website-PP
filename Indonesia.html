<h2> History: </h2>

<p>
Indonesia was historically in a position of a trading empire with states such as the Srivijaya empire and
the Majapahit Empire having ruled over many of its territories of the archipelago.
</p>
<br>
<p>
It was not long before European settlers arrived with the goal of taking over the spice trade that went through the islands in
order to make their empires richer and greater. The Portuguese and the Dutch spent some time fighting over the region but at
the end the Dutch came on top and ruled over Indonesia’s modern borders.
</p>
<br>
<p>
In World War 2 the Japanese occupied Indonesia and gave the final push to help the Indonesians declare Independence which started
a 4 year long war against the Dutch. This war ended with an Indonesian victory and safely established Indonesia as a nation.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Indonesia started off as a “guided democracy” under Sukarno with a parliamentary system until 1967. It then moved to a
dictatorship under Suharto until 1998 when Indonesia turned into its current system of a Republic. Through these years
Indonesia has seen many ups and downs with economic turmoil and times of prosperity.
</p>
<br>
<h2> Current State </h2>
<br>

Indonesia is in a state of an economy with a lot of potential to grow as it has been previously stated that the archipelago
has many natural resources that have interested many European powers. With these natural resources creates a stable income
for the country for now leading it to be able to diversify and expand their economy into greater heights.
</p>
<br>
<p>
In recent years Indonesia has combated poverty and is expanding their middle class with rising incomes and growing economy.
This is done though a growing service sector as more and more people are beginning to urbanize.
</p>
<br>
<p>
This is sounding similar to the story of Brazil with a growing economy. It is important to see that Indonesia can fall under
a similar way to that of Brazil with the middle-income trap.  With a bad infrastructure system in most of its island this
prevents Indonesia from unleashing many of its potential from the other parts of the nation.
</p>
<br>
<p>
To compare economic output in Indonesia we can investigate the comparison of population and share of GDP in the country.
Jakarta is Indonesia’s capital city and has a population of 10 million people. That is about 1/27 of the population. Jakarta’s
GDP is 200 billion which is 1/5 of the Indonesian GDP. This shows that Indonesia is severely underperforming.
</p>
<br>
<p>
If the productive output of Jakarta would be applied throughout Indonesia its GDP would be 5.4 trillion which would make it the
3rd largest economy in the world just above Japan. This is ignoring the ability to connect and innovate with such a rich and
productive population.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Indonesia also lacks much of the infrastructure needed for connecting cities and improve internal trading to create a cohesive
economy. This lack of infrastructure was also one of the factors that contributed to Brazil falling into the middle-income
trap. This issue did not go unnoticed by the government as one of the goals of the current administration is the construction
and expansion of many railways in Indonesia.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Infrastructure and connection between cities and population centers are needed to create complex supply lines and trade between
cities to allow for more complex and in-depth innovation and ideas that drive more richer and modern economies.
</p>
<br>
<p>
With a lack of proper infrastructure Indonesia would be unable to create complex supply lines and connections that would spark
innovation and end up beginning to slow the Indonesian economy as a whole.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Indonesia despite being an archipelago that relies on trade (20% of its GDP relies on exporting natural resources) it does not
have a strong navy to exert its influence, protect its sovereignty/trade. This lack of a strong navy leaves it open to foreign
powers and influences as seen with many incidents with China recently as they begin projection their power and economic
influence to trap many nations into debt traps.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Overall, a few key issues have been found:
</p>
<li>
<ul> A lack of productive regions in the country </ul>
<ul> Terrible infrastructure </ul>
<ul> Weak foreign influence </ul>
</li>
<br>
<h2> Possible solutions: </h2>
<br>
<h3> Lack of Productive regions </h3>
<br>
<p>
This can be fixed similar to that of the bad infrastructure which is though connecting cities and improving productivity as
well as removing barriers of entry into the market. This will make entrepreneurs more willing to dare and have new ideas or
take a much greater part in the economy. This will boost the productivity and employ more people.
</p>
<br>
<h3> Terrible infrastructure </h3>
<br>
<p>
Infrastructure can be improved by having incentives such as tax cuts if a important railway or highway was built between cities
in a certain timeframe. This will incentivize companies to do so outside of the existing incentives to connect cities and have
their own tolls.
</p>
<br>
<h3> Weak foreign influence </h3>
<br>
<p>
Through additional defense spending Indonesia can protect their own waters and even expand their influence into other nations as this way it will improve the power of Indonesia and make it a strong nation and even a possible superpower.
</p>
<br>
<h2> Summary </h2>
<br>
<p>
Through additional defense spending Indonesia can protect their own waters and even expand their influence into other nations
as this way it will improve the power of Indonesia and make it a strong nation and even a possible superpower.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Indonesia is a verry interesting nation in terms of economic capabilities as it has a favorable population pyramid for now. This creates an opportunity for economic growth and potentially making the nation a powerhouse in the region. Indonesia is home to plenty of natural resources and is positioned in one of the most important regions of trade. This has created a stable bae of exports for the nation from which it diversifies.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Indonesia does face problems with an economy that underperforms and having a lack of infrastructure to connect between cities and establish proper supply systems and connections to create innovations that propel nations out of the middle income trap and into the global upper class.
