<p> The world is facing with scarcity and limited resources, although humans have unlimited wants.
  This results with the study of economics. Economics is concerned with the efficient
  allocation of such resources to production, distribution, and consumption. Economics also uses models
  and assumptions from each group to be able to create policies, and incentives that will maximize efficiency.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Such scarce resources can be divided into the factors of production. Every good that we have is a result of
  these factors of production. The factors of production are land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Land is the natural resources that goes into the production of products like trees, grass, animals, etc. Labour is
the human effort that is used to go into the production of the good such as the workers of a company. Capital
includes the man-made resources that are used in the production of products. Some examples of Capital as a factor of production include cars, planes, trucks, robots, etc. Entrepreneurship
is the final factor of production which is the person that would coordinate and combine all of the factors of production
to create finished products. This is usually in the leader of a company.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Opportunity cost is the cost that is faced when missing out on the next best option. For example, if you were playing games
for an hour that means that that hour would be lost for other actions such as reading books, developing skills, and starting
a new hobby.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Economies can also be split into 3 types which are mixed, market, and planned economy.

<p>
  Market economy: This kind of economy is based on the free market and private ownership being in control of everything in an
  economy. There are no real-life examples of a market economy although nations that are close include Singapore, New Zealand,
  Switzerland, Australia, and Ireland. These nations rank the best on the Heritage Foundation's 2021 economic freedom index.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Mixed economy: This kind of economic system combines both aspects from market and planned economies where there is a market
 economy with rules and regulations for the market to follow. Most nations today fit under this category.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Planned economy: This kind of economy is complete and total state ownership of everything where the economy is planned by
bureaucrats and experts in an economy. Nations that have tried such a system include the Soviet Union, North Korea, and Maoist
China.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Economics is a broad subject that can be broken down into many different sub groups that all have their own concerns. To begin
with economics that can be broken down into two subcategories which are microeconomics and macroeconomics.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2> Microeconomics </h2>
<br>
<img src="Microeconomics.png" alt="Picture of a supply and demand graph">
<br>
<p>
Microeconomics is concerned with the behavior of individuals and businesses in a small scale. Actions by these individuals
have ripple effects throughout the entire economy so it is important to understand microeconomics before macroeconomics.
One of the most important things to learn in microeconomics is supply and demand. Supply is the quantity of goods and services
that producers are willing and able to produce at a given time and price. Meanwhile demand is the quantity of goods and services
that consumers are willing and are able to produce at a given time and price.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The supply and demand of a good can be plotted in a graph where the demand is in a generally downward sloping trend and supply
is in an upward sloping trend. The point where these two graphs meet is the equilibrium point and it is believed to reach that
point after price shifting in a market economy.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Microeconomics can be further broken down into different branches of economics although they will not be discussed in depth
which are:
</p>
<br>
<p>
Neo-classical economics: Neoclassical economics is a study in economics that focusses on the supply and demand aspects of
microeconomics to effect production, consumption, and pricing of goods and services.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Behavioral economics: This type of economics has a psychological implication towards economics. Psychology is used in behavioral
economics to explain the economic decision making that occurs in economies.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Environmental economics: This is the study of economics from an environmental perspective and prioritizes the sustainability
and monetary value of ecosystems.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2> Macroeconomics </h2>
<br>
<div class="ECNPic1">

</div>
<br>
<p>
Microeconomics studies what happens in a small scale between people and businesses. It also goes under the assumption that the
economy is a mostly market economy. In macroeconomics it covers economies as a while and is exposed to the different economic
systems.
</p>
<br>
<p>
In macroeconomics terms like inflation, unemployment, GDP, etc. get used often to track the condition and economic health of a
nation. This kind of economics is what will be emphasized in the website and many of the analysis for the countries.
Macroeconomics is more concerned with the “bigger picture” of the economy and attempts to grow the economy through its actions
and efforts. Macroeconomics tends to use tools like the government and central bank to guide the economy and generate growth and
prosperity among all of its participants
</p>
<br>
<p>
GDP: GDP is also known the gross domestic product which is the amount of goods that are produced in the economy.  An estimated
 growth of 3% a year for a GDP is a sign of growth and should be targeted by most countries.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Unemployment: This is the amount of people that don’t have a job in the economy and is marked as a percentage of the labour
force.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Inflation: This is the rate at which prices are rising in an economy which usually causes growth in an economy but too much
inflation would cause the complete destruction of an economy. Keeping inflation below 4% is a general target for most countries.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Monetary policy: This is the way that the government would control the amount of money in the economy as well as the amount of
new money put into the economy. This can be done by printing money and changing interest rates.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Fiscal policy: These are the policies used by the government to affect the economy. Through taxation and spending the fiscal
policy of a government can be investigated.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Through measures such as inflation, GDP, and unemployment they are able to track the effects of their monetary and fiscal
policies and how they have affected the nation as a whole. They can also be used by investors to change their stance on their
investment into countries as they make a clearer understanding of the economic environment of a country.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Macroeconomics also found the business cycle or the boom-and-bust cycle. Over a long period of time, it is found that economies
go through a cycle where there would be a period of massive economic growth which is known as the boom where there is massive
economic growth in an economy. Then there would be a bust where an economy crashes and faces a recession.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Examples of this taking place is in the early 2000’s where there is a period of economic growth. Then in 2008 a crash occurred
out of the American housing market. This created a bust and unemployment rose as well as a reduction in GDP and a rise in
inflation.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Macroeconomics has many schools of thought and the ones that will be discussed are Keynesian, New classical, Austrian, and
Marxist economics.
</p>
<br>
<h3> Keynesian economics </h3>
<br>
<p>
This kind of economics is what is used by most western countries where they do have a market economy that is usually free
although they add in barriers and boundaries for the market to work. Keynesians focus on aggregate demand which is the total
amount of demand in an economy and uses stimulus, quantitative easing, and pump priming to improve aggregate demand. Keynesians
also believe that due to sticky wages and prices that it blocks the true nature of the real supply and demand in an economy.
<p>
<br>
<h3> New classical economics </h3>
<br>
<p>
This kind of economics attempts to integrate microeconomics into macroeconomics. New classical economics aim to get the models
based on behavior of the consumer to be used more in macroeconomics. New classical economists believe that unemployment is
mostly voluntary. Discretionary fiscal policy destabilizes an economy and inflation should be controlled thought monetary policy.
</p>
<br>
<h3> Austrian economics </h3>
<br>
<p>
Austrian economics is similar to New classical economics in their attempt to try and integrate micro and macroeconomics.
Austrian theories also combine micro and macroeconomics to create their own analysis and puts an emphasis on the individual and
believes in freer markets. One of the most prominent theory from Austrian economics is the Austrian business cycle theory.
In this theory when there is a perceived increase in the money supply entrepreneurs would borrow more to start their projects.
This creates a rise in economic growth and creates the boom. Entrepreneurs undertake longer term investments and when they
turn a loss it begins to create a recession as these entrepreneurs are unable to pay back the loans.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Through the application of the theory in a real-life boom and bust cycle (for the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis). In the years
leading up to the crash the interest rates from the central bank have been reduced. This encourages individuals to spend more
than save because of the low interest rates.  People began borrowing more than they should have as there is an artificially
low interest rate and more subprime borrowers began borrowing at lower interest rates. Eventually these subprime borrowers were
unable to pay back the loans when prices rose and this canceled a lot of long-term house construction which made companies turn
a loss. This resulted in the 2008 recession.
</p>
<br>
<h3> Marxist economics </h3>
<br>
<p>
Marxist economics states the importance of the labour factor of production and is critical to the classical theory of economics.
Marxist economics was based on Karl Marx and his works in Das Kapital. Marxist economics is critical of capitalism and states
that such a system with specialized labour force and a rapidly growing population is pushing wages down and is ignorant of the
value that is present in labour that adds to goods.
